  <h1> <b><i><u> WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO</u></i></b></h1><br>
  
  <h2>GRAPHIC DESIGNING THROUGH (FIGMA)</h2>
  <p>"I had a great experience working with Figma as a graphic designer,
     where I explored a wide range of design possibilities—from wireframing and 
     UI mockups to complete branding layouts. Its collaborative features allowed me to work efficiently 
     with clients and developers in real-time, ensuring clear communication and fast iterations. Figma’s 
     versatility helped me bring creative ideas to life with precision and consistency, and it became an 
     essential part of my design workflow for creating visually appealing and user-focused designs."</p>

<h2> FRONT END DESIGNING OF WESITE </h2>
<p>"I had a great experience working on front-end website development from scratch using Visual Studio Code.
     I built responsive and interactive web pages using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, focusing on clean
      code and user-friendly design. This hands-on work helped me understand the core structure of
       web development, enhance my problem-solving skills, and improve the visual appeal and functionality 
       of websites. It was a rewarding process that strengthened both my technical foundation and creative 
       approach to web design."</p>
